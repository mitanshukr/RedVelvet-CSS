A fictional landing page made with CSS/SCSS.

I made this single page website while doing practice of CSS and scss. Hope you like it.

## Stacks used:

1. Cool Animation of heart(.svg), on top section and on few buttons while hovering.
2. Use of custom font. (StayClassy)
3. CSS grid to create gallery.
4. Structured model of SCSS, and sorted file structing.
5. Responsive to all size screens.
